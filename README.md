## Usage

This orb is a orb wrapper for the [Public Code Parser](https://github.com/italia/publiccode-parser-go)  
You can use it in your workflow to easly check if your publiccode.yml is valid.  

##Â How to add it to your Workflow

The orb is of course OpenSoure and accessible in the [Orb Registry](https://circleci.com/orbs/registry/orb/romain325/pcvalidate-orb)  
You just need to reference it in the orbs section of your workflow like so:

```yml
orbs:
    romain325/pcvalidate-orb@<version>
    # Other orbs
```

## How to use it  

For precise example, you can refer to the [examples](src/examples/example.yml).  

### Default use

Default path is the current path(root of your project) and **publiccode.yml** as the name of your file

```yml
- workflows:
    thats-a-workflow:
        jobs:

```
